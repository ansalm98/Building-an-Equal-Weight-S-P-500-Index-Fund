# Equal-Weight-S-P-500-Index-Fund-Project
Welcome to the Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index Fund project! In this project, we aim to create a Python script that will help you construct an equal-weight version of the S&amp;P 500 index fund. By doing so, you can achieve diversification across all constituents of the index without having to manually calculate the weights for each stock.
